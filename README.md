This is the code repository for [C# Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.packtpub.com/product/c-data-structures-and-algorithms-second-edition/9781803248271), published by Packt.

**Harness the power of C# to build a diverse range of efficient applications**

## What is this book about?
Explore efficient data organization in C# with this guide to implementing and utilizing diverse data structures, along with common algorithms, offering reusable solutions for effective development.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the fundamentals of algorithms and their classification
* Store data using arrays and lists, and explore various ways to sort arrays
* Build enhanced applications with stacks, queues, hashtables, dictionaries, and sets
* Create efficient applications with tree-related algorithms, such as for searching in a binary search tree
* Boost solution efficiency with graphs, including finding the shortest path in the graph
* Implement algorithms solving Tower of Hanoi and Sudoku games, generating fractals, and even guessing the title of this book

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter03.

The code will look like the following:
```
int[,] numbers = new int[,]
{
{ 9, 5, -9 },
{ -11, 4, 0 },
{ 6, 115, 3 },
{ -12, -9, 71 },
{ 1, -6, -1 }
};

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for developers looking to learn data structures and algorithms in C#. While basic programming skills and C# knowledge is useful, beginners will find value in the provided code snippets, illustrations, and detailed explanations, enhancing their programming skills. Advanced developers can use this book as a valuable resource for reusable code snippets, instead of writing algorithms from scratch each time.
